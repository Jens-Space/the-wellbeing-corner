# 🌱 Mental Health Hub

Mental Health Hub is an inclusive, compassionate website built with **Next.js**, designed to support **adults, teens, and children**, including those affected by **chronic pain, invisible illness, and mood disorders**.

This project focuses on education, validation, accessibility, and safe signposting — not diagnosis or treatment.

---

## 💙 Mission Statement

Mental Health Hub exists to provide a safe, supportive space for people of all ages to learn about mental health and understand their experiences without judgement.

Mental health is shaped by many factors — trauma, life events, chronic pain, invisible illness, disability, and social pressures. Whether struggles are visible or hidden, short-term or lifelong, every experience is valid.

Our mission is to reduce stigma, increase understanding, and remind people that **they are not alone**.

> This website provides support and education and does not replace professional mental health care.
